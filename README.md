- 👋 Hi, I’m José Tafla, aka @taflaj
- 👀 I’m interested in all things technology, including decentralized systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving on my Python skills to get ready for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I'm also looking forward to learning Rust and Codility, depending on my next endeavor. Being the curious person I am, and considering I'm a strong advocate towards functional programming, I have Elixir on my radar. In my spare time, I've been studying data science and enhancing my R skills.
-   In recent weeks I've been playing with [suckless tools](https://suckless.org/). I'm currently running dwm and related tools on my [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) machines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building RESTful APIs using microservices and RPC to support any front-end application you may need.
