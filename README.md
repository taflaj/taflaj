- 👋 Hi, I’m José Tafla, aka @taflaj
- 👀 I’m interested in all things technology, including decentralized systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving on my Python skills by participating on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I'm also looking forward to learning Rust and Codility, depending on my next endeavor. Being the curious person I am, and considering I'm a strong advocate towards functional programming, I have Elixir on my radar.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building RESTful APIs using microservices and RPC to support any front-end application you may need.
- 📫 How to reach me: jose@tafla.com
